# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. GSAP Animation Problems
- ✅ Added client-side check to prevent SSR issues
- ✅ Added `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` after initialization
- ✅ Added 100ms delay to ensure DOM is ready before animations
- ✅ Proper cleanup of timers and ScrollTrigger instances

### 2. Image Optimization
- ✅ Added `priority` prop to hero image for faster LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
- ✅ Configured Next.js image optimization in `next.config.ts`

### 3. Build Configuration
- ✅ Removed `--turbopack` flag from production build (better Vercel compatibility)
- ✅ Added webpack config for static asset handling

## Additional Steps to Take on Vercel

### Before Deploying:
1. **Check Image Paths**: Ensure all images exist in `/public/images/` directory
2. **Build Locally**: Run `npm run build` to test for any errors
3. **Check Console**: Look for any warnings or errors in the build output

### On Vercel Dashboard:
1. **Environment Variables**: If you have any, make sure they're set
2. **Build Settings**: 
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
3. **Node Version**: Ensure it matches your local version (check with `node -v`)

### After Deployment:
1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. **Check Network Tab**: Look for any 404 errors on images or assets
3. **Check Console**: Look for JavaScript errors

## Common Issues & Solutions

### If animations still don't work:
- Open browser DevTools console and check for errors
- Verify GSAP is being loaded: Search for `gsap` in Network tab
- Try adding `use client` directive if it's missing

### If images don't load:
- Verify image file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check that images are in `/public/images/` folder
- Look for 404 errors in Network tab

### If styles look broken:
- Clear Vercel cache and redeploy
- Check if Tailwind CSS is configured correctly
- Verify all CSS imports are present

## Redeploy Command
After these changes, commit and push to trigger a new Vercel deployment:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: deployment issues with animations and images"
git push
```

Or manually trigger redeploy in Vercel dashboard.
